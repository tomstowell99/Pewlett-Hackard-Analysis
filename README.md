# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Silver Tsunami at Pewlett-Hackard
  We have been tasked with reviewing the aging work force at Pewlett-Hackard. Our tasks are to determine the number of retiring employees by title, determine who is 
  eligible for inclusion in the mentorship program and a final analsys of the employee database.
  
  ## Results
  
  * The number of employees retiring by title is shown in our chart below.

     * We have sorted the list in descending order by number of employees expected to retire. You can see that we are expecting to lose our Senior Engineers and 
       Senior Staff positions at a much higher rate than our less experienced staff.
       
     * From this attrition we will need to train our less experienced Engineers and Staff positions to assume these senior roles in the coming years. 
     
 * Toward the goal of training our future Seniors leaders. We have put together a list of employees eligible for the Mentorship program.
   The full list is included as a csv file but a summary by role is shown below.

      * There a not a great deal of employees in the pipeline in comparison to those that are retiring. For example there are 24,926 Senior Staff that will be retiring
        soon and we have only identified 155 staff and 569 Senior staff for the mentorship program.
        
      * Of those employees we have identified for the Mentorship program. The majority hold a Senior position but not all do. This may affect their ability to partake
        in the program.
     
     * Summary
        
        * How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
          Using the query below. We can see that we will need to replace 72,458 workers in the near future.

        * Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewelett Hackard employees?
          No there are not enought employees in the pipe line. The number of staff we are anticipating to lose far exceeds what we have in our pipeling
          as demonstrated in our second chart above.
          
        * I have created a bin by age group to show the signifcant bubble we have in employees nearing retirement age compared to our next age group.
          As you can see we have over a two to one ratio of those over 60 compared to those in the 51 to 60 age group. This will put a great deal 
          of pressure on that 51-60 group as older group retires and takes their knowledge with them.

          * Finally we looked at which departments would be impacted most by retirements. All areas are important but we feel we should initially focus on development             as this will have the longest lasting impact on our pipeling of product.
